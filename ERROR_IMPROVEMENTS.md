# Error Handling Improvements Summary

## Overview

The favis codebase has been successfully enhanced with improved error handling and recovery suggestions while maintaining simplicity and conciseness.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Centralized Error System** (`src/error.rs`)

- Created a custom `FavisError` struct with context and recovery suggestions
- Removed dependency on `anyhow` crate for cleaner, more focused error handling
- Provides user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions

### 2. **Error Types and Recovery Suggestions**

- **File Not Found**: Suggests checking file paths and existence
- **Permission Denied**: Recommends elevated permissions or checking file permissions
- **Invalid Format**: Guides users to use supported image formats (SVG, PNG, JPEG, GIF)
- **Image Too Small**: Suggests using larger images or SVG for better quality
- **Invalid SVG**: Provides guidance on SVG syntax issues
- **Write Errors**: Helps with output directory and permission issues
- **Processing Errors**: Context-aware suggestions for memory and resource issues

### 3. **Automatic Error Conversions**

Implemented `From` traits for common error types:

- `std::io::Error` → contextual file/permission errors
- `image::ImageError` → format and size validation errors
- `resvg::usvg::Error` → SVG parsing errors
- `serde_json::Error` → JSON format errors

### 4. **Enhanced Error Display**

- Color-coded error messages using `owo-colors`
- Clear separation between error context and suggestions
- User-friendly formatting that doesn't overwhelm

### 5. **Validation Improvements**

- **File Existence**: Check source files before processing
- **Image Dimensions**: Validate minimum image size (64x64 pixels)
- **SVG Content**: Validate SVG data is not empty
- **Directory Creation**: Better handling of output directory creation
- **Memory Management**: Improved pixmap creation with memory context

### 6. **Graceful Error Recovery**

- Non-critical errors (like cleanup failures) are handled gracefully
- User gets clear feedback about what went wrong and how to fix it
- Process exits cleanly with appropriate error codes

## Example Error Messages

### Before:

```
Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

### After:

```
Error: Source file: nonexistent.svg
Suggestion: Check the file path and ensure the file exists
```

## Code Quality Improvements

### Removed Dependencies

- Eliminated `anyhow` dependency, reducing build time and binary size
- Cleaner import statements and reduced complexity

### Better Resource Management

- Proper error handling for temporary file operations
- Graceful cleanup with non-failing deletion
- Memory-aware pixmap creation with descriptive errors

### Enhanced User Experience

- Clear, actionable error messages
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Contextual suggestions based on error type

## Testing Results

The improved error handling has been tested with:

1. **Non-existent files** → Clear file not found message with path guidance
2. **Invalid image formats** → Format validation with supported format suggestions
3. **Help command** → All functionality remains intact
4. **Compilation** → Clean build with no warnings (except for intended unused fields)

## Benefits

1. **Conciseness**: Removed verbose error handling while improving clarity
2. **User-Friendly**: Non-technical users get helpful guidance
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized error handling makes code easier to maintain
4. **Reliability**: Better validation prevents runtime issues
5. **Performance**: Removed unnecessary dependencies and improved error paths

The error handling improvements maintain the tool's simplicity while providing much better user experience and debugging capabilities.
